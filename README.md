# mcq_generator

Welcome to MCQ Generator! This project uses large language models and machine learning algorithms to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQs) with answers and explanations based on the number of questions and subject given by the user.
Here are the details of the project:
* **Installation**: To install the required packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
* **Tools**: The project uses the following tools:
+ Python programming language
+ Langchain
+ OpenAI' Ins gpt-3.5-turbo' algorithm for generating questions and answers
+ Streamlit for web deployment
+ Amazon EC2 for deployment
* **Usage**: To run the entire application, run `python streamlit_app.py` in your terminal.
# Features
--------
The MCQ Generator has the following features:
* Generates MCQs with answers and explanations based on the number of questions and subject given by the user.
* Uses large language models and machine learning algorithms to generate high-quality questions and answers.
* Deployed on Streamlit, making it accessible through a web interface.
* Can be deployed on Amazon EC2 for scalability and reliability.
# Getting Started
---------------
1. Clone the repository and install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run `python streamlit_app.py` in your terminal to start the application.
3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to access the application.
4. Enter the number of questions and select a subject to generate MCQs.
5. Click on "Generate MCQs" to see the generated questions, answers, and explanations.
# Troubleshooting
---------------
If you encounter any issues while running the application, please check the following:
* Make sure you have installed all the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
* Check that you have the latest version of Streamlit installed.
* Ensure that your internet connection is stable, as the application uses OpenAI's API for generating questions and answers.
* If you encounter any errors while deploying on Amazon EC2, check the AWS documentation for troubleshooting steps.
